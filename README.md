# Exploring Healthcare Outcomes & Costs by Patient Demographics and Admission Factors

 ## Project Overview
This project explores how patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital characteristics, and insurance factors influence healthcare costs and clinical outcomes within a hospital network.

The goal is to provide hospital administration with actionable insights into variations in treatment costs, length of stay, and test outcomes, to support strategic decision-making around quality improvement, cost management, and patient care.

## Business Questions Addressed:
* Which medical conditions drive the highest treatment costs?

* How does length of stay vary by patient demographics (age, gender) and condition?

* What is the distribution of abnormal test results across hospitals and conditions?

* How do admission type and insurance provider impact healthcare costs and outcomes?

## Approach:
The raw healthcare dataset was cleaned and prepared in R, with key fields engineered to support deeper analysis (Age Groups, % Abnormal Test Rates, etc.).

An interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to visualize trends and support self-service exploration by hospital leadership.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to filter by hospital, medical condition, insurance provider, admission type, age group, and gender.

## Key Insights for Hospital Leadership:
* Obesity and Cancer are the conditions associated with the highest average treatment costs.

* Length of stay increases with patient age and varies significantly by gender for certain conditions.

* Certain hospitals demonstrate a higher percentage of abnormal test results, suggesting potential quality improvement opportunities.

* Insurance type and admission type correlate with variations in billing amounts and outcomes, offering avenues for more efficient care pathways.

The dashboard is designed to enable hospital administrators to quickly identify cost drivers, quality concerns, and demographic trends, empowering data-driven decision making in healthcare operations.

## Tools Used
- R (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
- Tableau Public (Dashboard Development)
